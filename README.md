## The source code for one-phase simplex method and two-phase simplex method

This is a library written in Python for the simplex method in Linear Programming. The library includes one-phase simplex and two-phase simplex method.

The library can solve the linear pramming problem with mixed constraints.

### File structure:
- **simplex.py**: the implementation of one-phase simplex class
- **simplex2.py**: the implementation of two-phase simplex class
- **test_simplex.py**, **test_simplex2.py**: the script to test the library
- **test_simplex.ipynb**, **test_simplex2.ipynb**: the test results in jupyter notebook

### Usage:

#### One-phase simplex
```python
### Requirements
Python 3.x with **numpy** library installed.
